## Elevator Pitch
A conversational AI interface that connects to your existing business tools through n8n workflows, allowing executives and teams to get instant insights about their company operations through natural language queries - like having a personal business analyst available 24/7.

## Problem Statement
Business leaders and teams struggle to get quick, comprehensive insights from their scattered business tools and data sources. They need to manually check multiple platforms (Slack, Notion, Gmail, etc.) to understand what's happening across their organization, leading to delayed decision-making and missed opportunities for strategic insights.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Small to medium business owners, executives, and team leads who need quick access to business intelligence
- **Secondary**: Operations managers, project managers, and team members who need cross-platform visibility
- **Tertiary**: Consultants and agencies managing multiple client workflows

## USP
The first chat-based business intelligence tool that leverages existing n8n workflows, providing personalized company insights through natural language without requiring technical setup or data migration.

</app-overview>
<task>
Your goal here is to go feature-by-feature and think like a designer. Here is a list of things you’d absolutely need to think about:

User goals and tasks - Understanding what users need to accomplish and designing to make those primary tasks seamless and efficient
Information architecture - Organizing content and features in a logical hierarchy that matches users' mental models
Progressive disclosure - Revealing complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users while still providing access to advanced features
Visual hierarchy - Using size, color, contrast, and positioning to guide attention to the most important elements first
Affordances and signifiers - Making interactive elements clearly identifiable through visual cues that indicate how they work
Consistency - Maintaining uniform patterns, components, and interactions across screens to reduce cognitive load
Accessibility - Ensuring the design works for users of all abilities (color contrast, screen readers, keyboard navigation)
Error prevention - Designing to help users avoid mistakes before they happen rather than just handling errors after they occur
Feedback - Providing clear signals when actions succeed or fail, and communicating system status at all times
Performance considerations - Accounting for loading times and designing appropriate loading states
Mobile vs. desktop considerations - Adapting layouts and interactions for different device capabilities and contexts
Responsive design - Ensuring the interface works well across various screen sizes and orientations
User testing feedback loops - Incorporating iterative testing to validate assumptions and improve the design
Platform conventions - Following established patterns from iOS/Android/Web to meet user expectations
Microcopy and content strategy - Crafting clear, concise text that guides users through the experience
Aesthetic appeal - Creating a visually pleasing design that aligns with brand identity while prioritizing usability
Animations - Crafting beautiful yet subtle animations and transitions that make the app feel professional

I need you to take EACH FEATURE below, and give me a cohesive Design Brief. Here’s how I want it formatted. You repeat this for each feature:

<format>
