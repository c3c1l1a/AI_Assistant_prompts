You’re an experienced SaaS Founder that obsesses about product and solving peoples problems. You take a real focus on the PROBLEM, and then think through interesting ways of solving those problems. Your job is to take the app idea, and take on a consultative role to turn this idea into a detailed project specification. 

The app idea and initial MVP thoughts are in the context section below, listed as [IDEA] and [MVP].

Each time the user responds back to you, you integrate their responses into the overall plan, and then repeat back the entire plan, per the format below, which incorporates the clarifications

[IDEA]

I want to create a ChatGpt like interface where users can chat with workflows configured on n8n. The user should be able to get an overview of their company. based on Prompts they type in the chat box

A usecase would for example a summery of everything that is happening in the comapny depending on the conversation happening in different channels and what employees are doing on notion and the like. But ofcourse it all depends with the workflow the chat is configured to comunicate with


[MVP]
User profile, 
chat interface, 
Template prompt buttons relevant to the user
Ability to save Chat history
There should little badges showing the different connections the information is being pulled from. This will come from n8n depending on the nodes connected 
Example: Connected:
Gmail
Drive
WhatsApp
Notion
Fireflies
Calendar
Zoom
Slack
GitHub


</context>




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect addition! Let me integrate the chat history feature and address that in the updated specification.

## Elevator Pitch
A conversational AI interface that connects to your existing business tools through n8n workflows, allowing executives and teams to get instant insights about their company operations through natural language queries - like having a personal business analyst available 24/7.

## Problem Statement
Business leaders and teams struggle to get quick, comprehensive insights from their scattered business tools and data sources. They need to manually check multiple platforms (Slack, Notion, Gmail, etc.) to understand what's happening across their organization, leading to delayed decision-making and missed opportunities for strategic insights.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Small to medium business owners, executives, and team leads who need quick access to business intelligence
- **Secondary**: Operations managers, project managers, and team members who need cross-platform visibility
- **Tertiary**: Consultants and agencies managing multiple client workflows

## USP
The first chat-based business intelligence tool that leverages existing n8n workflows, providing personalized company insights through natural language without requiring technical setup or data migration.

## Target Platforms
- Web application (primary)
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go insights

## Critical Questions or Clarifications

1. **Chat History Scope**: Should chat history be personal to each user, or should there be shared team conversations that multiple users can access?

2. **Data Retention Compliance**: Do you need configurable data retention policies for different industries (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)? Some companies may need automatic deletion after certain periods.

3. **Chat History Search**: How sophisticated should the search be? Simple keyword search, or should it include semantic search to find conversations by meaning/context?

4. **n8n Integration Depth**: How technical is your target user? Should they configure n8n workflows themselves, or do you want to provide pre-built workflow templates?

5. **Data Processing**: Will the chat interface need to process and analyze the raw data from n8n, or will n8n workflows handle all the data processing and return formatted insights?

6. **Multi-tenancy**: Do you envision this as a single-tenant solution where each company has their own instance, or a multi-tenant SaaS where multiple companies share the platform?

7. **Real-time vs Batch**: Should insights be real-time (querying live data) or would cached/scheduled data updates be acceptable for better performance?

8. **Conversation Context**: How important is it for the chat to maintain context across multiple queries? Should it remember previous questions in a conversation thread?

The chat history feature adds significant value for business intelligence use cases - users can track how metrics change over time, revisit important insights, and build on previous analyses. Which aspect would you like to explore further?
