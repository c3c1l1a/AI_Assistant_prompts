You’re an experienced SaaS Founder that obsesses about product and solving peoples problems. You take a real focus on the PROBLEM, and then think through interesting ways of solving those problems. Your job is to take the app idea, and take on a consultative role to turn this idea into a detailed project specification. 

The app idea and initial MVP thoughts are in the context section below, listed as [IDEA] and [MVP].

Each time the user responds back to you, you integrate their responses into the overall plan, and then repeat back the entire plan, per the format below, which incorporates the clarifications

[IDEA]

I want to create a ChatGpt like interface where users can chat with workflows configured on n8n. The user should be able to get an overview of their company. based on Prompts they type in the chat box

A usecase would for example a summery of everything that is happening in the comapny depending on the conversation happening in different channels and what employees are doing on notion and the like. But ofcourse it all depends with the workflow the chat is configured to comunicate with


[MVP]
User profile, 
chat interface, 
Template prompt buttons relevant to the user
Ability to save Chat history
There should little badges showing the different connections the information is being pulled from. This will come from n8n depending on the nodes connected 
Example: Connected:
Gmail
Drive
WhatsApp
Notion
Fireflies
Calendar
Zoom
Slack
GitHub

## Elevator Pitch
A plug-and-play conversational business intelligence platform that connects to your company's n8n instance, automatically generates relevant prompts based on your connected services, and delivers real-time company insights through natural language conversations - no technical setup required.

## Problem Statement
Business leaders and teams struggle to get a holistic view of their company's operations because critical information is siloed across multiple tools. Even with workflow automation like n8n, accessing insights still requires technical knowledge to query data effectively. Teams need a simple, conversational interface that can instantly pull real-time information from their existing n8n workflows without requiring technical expertise.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Small to medium business owners and executives already using n8n (10-500 employees)
- **Secondary**: Operations managers, team leads, and department heads in n8n-enabled organizations
- **Technical requirement**: Companies with existing n8n instances (positioned as an add-on solution)

## USP
The first conversational interface for n8n workflows that automatically generates contextual business prompts and delivers real-time insights through chat, transforming technical workflow automation into accessible business intelligence.

## Target Platforms
- Web application (primary)
- Mobile-responsive design for real-time monitoring

## Features List

### User Management & Company Setup
- [ ] As a company admin, I want to connect my n8n instance to enable chat functionality
- [ ] As a user, I want to authenticate through my company's system to access our specific data
- [ ] As an admin, I want to manage team member access and permissions within our n8n scope

### n8n Instance Integration
- [ ] As a system, I need to connect to company-specific n8n instances via API
- [ ] As a system, I need to discover available workflows and their capabilities automatically
- [ ] As a system, I need to maintain real-time connection status with the n8n instance

### Intelligent Chat Interface
- [ ] As a user, I want to type natural language queries that get translated to n8n workflow calls
- [ ] As a user, I want to see real-time responses from my company's live data
- [ ] As a user, I want the chat to understand context and maintain conversation flow

### Context-Aware Prompt Generation Engine
- [ ] As a system, I need to analyze data from connected services to identify business entities (clients, projects, team members, deals)
- [ ] As a system, I need to understand relationships between entities across different platforms (e.g., Slack channels related to specific clients)
- [ ] As a user, I want to see intelligent prompts like "What's the latest on the Johnson deal?" based on actual client names from my CRM
- [ ] As a user, I want contextual prompts that combine multiple data sources ("How is the marketing team's campaign performance affecting sales calls?")
- [ ] As a system, I need to learn from user interactions to improve prompt relevance over time

### Business Entity Recognition
- [ ] As a system, I need to extract and maintain a knowledge graph of business entities from all connected services
- [ ] As a system, I need to identify key people, projects, clients, and initiatives across platforms
- [ ] As a user, I want prompts that reference actual names and contexts from my business data
- [ ] As a system, I need to handle entity disambiguation (e.g., "Johnson" the client vs "Johnson" the employee)

### Auto-Generated Template Prompts
- [ ] As a system, I need to analyze connected n8n nodes to generate relevant prompt templates
- [ ] As a user, I want to see contextual prompt suggestions that match my available data sources
- [ ] As a user, I want prompt templates to update automatically when new services are connected to n8n

### Real-Time Data Streaming
- [ ] As a user, I want to receive live updates when relevant data changes (new Slack messages, calendar events, etc.)
- [ ] As a system, I need to establish webhook connections for real-time data flow
- [ ] As a user, I want to see "live" indicators when data is actively streaming

### Service Connection Visualization
- [ ] As a user, I want to see which services are connected through my n8n workflows with live status badges
- [ ] As a user, I want to understand which specific n8n nodes contributed to each response
- [ ] As a user, I want clear error messages when n8n workflows fail or connections drop

### Chat History & Context Management
- [ ] As a user, I want to save conversation history with searchable context
- [ ] As a user, I want to organize chats by business topics or time periods
- [ ] As a system, I need to maintain conversation context while respecting data privacy

### UX/UI Considerations
- [ ] **Connection Setup**: Simple n8n instance connection wizard with API key input and validation
- [ ] **Live Data Indicators**: Pulsing badges and real-time counters showing active data streams
- [ ] **Template Prompt Generation**: Dynamic suggestion chips that appear/disappear based on available workflows
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: Toast notifications and live message updates without page refresh
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of n8n downtime with retry mechanisms
- [ ] **Mobile Real-time**: Push notification support for critical business alerts

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Performance**: Real-time response under 2 seconds, handle 100+ concurrent n8n workflow calls
- [ ] **Scalability**: Support multiple n8n instances per company, auto-scaling based on workflow complexity
- [ ] **Security**: Encrypted n8n API connections, no data storage of sensitive business information
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Voice-to-text support for mobile users, keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful n8n connection failure handling

## Monetization
- **Freemium Model**: Free tier for single n8n instance, up to 5 users, basic templates
- **Business Plan**: $49/month per n8n instance for unlimited users, advanced templates, priority support
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for on-premise deployment, dedicated templates, white-labeling
