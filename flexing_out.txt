[IDEA]

I want to create a ChatGpt like interface where users can chat with workflows configured on n8n. The user should be able to get an overview of their company. based on Prompts they type in the chat. 

A usecase would for example a summery of everything that is happening in the comapny depending on the conversation happening in different channels and what employees are doing on notion and the like. But ofcourse it all depends with the workflow the chat is configured to comunicate with


[MVP]
User profile, 
chat interface, 
Template prompt buttons relevant to the user
