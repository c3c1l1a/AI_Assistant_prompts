## Elevator Pitch
A conversational AI interface that connects to your existing business tools through n8n workflows, allowing executives and teams to get instant insights about their company operations through natural language queries - like having a personal business analyst available 24/7.

## Problem Statement
Business leaders and teams struggle to get quick, comprehensive insights from their scattered business tools and data sources. They need to manually check multiple platforms (Slack, Notion, Gmail, etc.) to understand what's happening across their organization, leading to delayed decision-making and missed opportunities for strategic insights.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Small to medium business owners, executives, and team leads who need quick access to business intelligence
- **Secondary**: Operations managers, project managers, and team members who need cross-platform visibility
- **Tertiary**: Consultants and agencies managing multiple client workflows

## USP
The first chat-based business intelligence tool that leverages existing n8n workflows, providing personalized company insights through natural language without requiring technical setup or data migration.



### UX/UI Considerations
- [ ] **Chat Interface**: Clean, WhatsApp/ChatGPT-style interface with message bubbles
- [ ] **Chat History Sidebar**: Collapsible left panel showing conversation list with preview text and dates
- [ ] **Search & Filter**: Global search bar with filters for date range, data sources, and conversation type
- [ ] **Loading States**: Show typing indicators, workflow execution progress, and data fetching status
- [ ] **Connection Badges**: Floating mini-badges showing active integrations with status indicators (green/red/yellow)
- [ ] **Template Drawer**: Expandable side panel or bottom sheet with categorized prompt templates
- [ ] **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex data responses can be expanded/collapsed for better readability
- [ ] **Conversation Threading**: Visual indicators for related queries and follow-up questions
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch-friendly interface with swipe gestures for navigation and chat management

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Performance**: Chat responses within 3-5 seconds for simple queries, progress indicators for complex workflows
- [ ] **Scalability**: Support for multiple concurrent users and workflow executions
- [ ] **Security**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive business data, secure API key management, encrypted chat history storage
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, high contrast mode
- [ ] **Data Retention**: Configurable chat history retention policies for compliance requirements
